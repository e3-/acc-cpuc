Model Template Documentation!
==============================================

Welcome to the documentation for your model! We use the `Sphinx package <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`_
for creating and managing our model documentation. Sphinx can be used to create remarkably complex documents, so please
see the Sphinx documentation (linked above) for more detailed instruction on customizing your own documentation.

For instructions on how to setup and customize the documentation for your model, see the :ref:`setup-instructions`.
